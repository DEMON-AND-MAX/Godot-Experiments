Godot Experiments

This is a compilation of various Godot projects, explorations and tools that I make to further understand the engine and its capabilities.

Each folder within this repository is a different Godot project with a different functionality.

Asset Glossary
- Script that automatically parses the "assets" folder and generates a map of paths to every asset within the system
- Allows for quick preloading of assets within a project, alongside checking if all files pertain to a desired standard (eg. it can enforce that certain file types shoud be converted)
